# First 10 digit prime in _e_

This project is a C version of the 'first 10 digit prime in _e_' problem. I saved _e_ in a text file called e.txt and then read that into the c program, which cuts it up in chunks of 10 digits, converts that to a long (since integers can't handle numbers of that size) and then checks whether or not the number is a prime. If so, it prints that it's done, if not it continues with the next slice of 10 digits. Check the main.c file for the source code! Thanks for watching.
